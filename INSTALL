   installed.  The latest "official" version can be found at

        http://www.tcpdump.org .

5. If you want (not necessary) that Xplico produces the geographical map of the reconstruction,
   then you must download GeoIP-1.4.5.tar.gz, and from the SAME directory where you unpack xplico
   you have to unpack GeoIP source code. After that you has to configure and compile GeoIP:
        cd GeoIP-1.4.6
        ./configure
        make
   No need to install GeoIP.
   In the end, download and unpack in the directory 'xplico' the GeoLite City database. Remember to
   unpack the db.
        http://www.maxmind.com/app/c (GeoIP C API)
        http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz (GeoLite City Binary Format)

6. Compile nDPI library. From the SAME directory where you unpack xplico:
     svn co https://svn.ntop.org/svn/ntop/trunk/nDPI
     cd nDPI
     ./configure --with-pic
     make

7. Run 'make' in the Xplico distribution directory. Hopefully, you won't run into any problems.

8. After running 'make', you will see xplico binary and modules directory.

9. If you wish to decode network printer job, make sure you have Ghostpcl. The latest "official" 
   version can be found at

        http://www.ghostscript.com/awki/Ghostpcl .

   Copy "pcl6" in Xplico home directory (in the same directory of xplico binary).

10. If you wish to decode RTP, SIP, MEGACO, H323, MGCP... VoIP audio codec, make sure you have videosnarf-0.62 compiled and patched with videosnarf_xplico.patch ( http://projects.xplico.org/patch/videosnarf_xplico.patch.gz ).

   Copy "videosnarf" in Xplico home directory (in the same directory of xplico binary).
   
11. Run './xplico' and make sure that everything are working. You must have root privileges in order to capture live data.

12. At this point you have Xplico in console mode, see README for use it.

13. If you use Xplico GUI it requires Apache, PHP and Perl. If you use Xplico in console mode
   it isn't necesary this software, and you can skeep this point and others.

14. Run 'make install'. Change the permisions of /opt/xplico, /opt/xplico/cfg and /opt/xplico/xi directories to permit that Apache user (PHP program) can create a subdirectory inside /opt/xplico
    Also change the permisions of all files in /opt/xplico/cfg to read and write by Apache.

15. With root permission run:
    /opt/xplico/script/sqlite_demo.sh

16. To configure Apache you can use the (example) configuration file: /opt/xplico/cfg/apache_xi

17. Enable proxy in Firefox. The proxy IP is the IP of machine where you have installed Xplico and port is 80 (Apache port).

18. The url to view Xplico Interface is: http://IP
    If you use the machine name and not IP it is possible that you don't enter in Web Interface

19. And now: Enjoy.
